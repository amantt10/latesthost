6:T43a, at West Virginia University (WVU), the CHP team will develop a Acquired Disabilities and Employment Portal that will be hosted on JAN’s extensive website with a link to CHP’s interactive project website. The portal will be a fully accessible, plain-language, and largely text-based resource populated with our own project findings as well as other information and resources related to the employment situation for people with disabilities experiencing Long COVID. Visitors to the portal will indicate their roles as workers with disabilities, employers, healthcare professionals, rehabilitation practitioners, etc. and be able to indicate their level of familiarity with the subject matter of particular sections of the portal, and the site will guide them to the level and type of information that is most compatible with their role and familiarity. The portal will feature multiple filters that may be applied to target users’ most immediate needs. Links will be provided to JAN’s other accommodation and ADA implementation resources that are part of its general website.0:{"P":null,"b":"BlfaYMg1a-pDJWGYgzYmz","p":"","c":["","pages","Resources","VR&HSP"],"i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["pages",{"children":["Resources",{"children":["VR&HSP",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],["",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/css/259e68bf2208cfb8.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":["$","body",null,{"children":["$","div",null,{"id":"__next","children":["$","main",null,{"className":"pt-24","children":["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"$undefined",[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]}]}]]}],{"children":["pages",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["Resources",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["VR&HSP",["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L2",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L3",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":["__PAGE__",["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","$L4",null,{}],["$","div",null,{"className":"xl:container mx-auto md:max-w-4xl max-w-sm w-8/10 relative xl:justify-items-center","children":[["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-3xl font-extrabold text-left justify-right mb-10 text-gray-800","children":"What does the Career Horizons Project do for VR & Health Service Providers?
